# Amrit Pandey

Hi, I am Amrit! I started coding as hobby in 2017 with JavaScript. The Developer community culture which formed around that time
helped me introduce to the interesting world of software development. Since my first day of coding, I haven't spent a day without
writing code. Eventually what started as passtime hobby turned into a full-time thing and now a pursuit to become software development
engineer. The thing which excites me the most about this field is that I get to develop softwares which people use and depend on in
their day-to-day life. I hope to bring lot of good changes in people's lives not just with my skills but also with my ideas.
