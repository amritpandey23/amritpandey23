# Amrit

My coding journey began in 2017 with JavaScript, driven by a passion for software development and the supportive developer community that emerged at that time(Treehouse, Freecodecamp, React.js etc.). From the very first day, coding became an unforgettable part of my life, evolving from a hobby to pursuing CS full-time (2020-2023) and to a profession (2023).

What excites me most about software development is the ability to create and build things. I view programming as an art form(against popular convention of problem solving) that brings value to people's lives. The joy I feel when others use and benefit from the applications I've developed is invaluable, and it fuels my dedication to this field.
